Manual Tests:

All shapes rendered with correct fill or unfilled toggle
BoundBoxes correctly rendered
Filled/Unfilled toggling all shapes upon intersection (e.g. Circle & Rect)
RightClick toggles shapes filled (verfiy also in console)
RightClick on Circle - does nothing - as expected
RightClick on Rectangle - invokes moveTenUnits() method - works as expected
RightClick on Quadrilateral - invokes rotate90degs() method - works as expected
